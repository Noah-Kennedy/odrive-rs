A community library for control of ODrive motor controllers.
This library was based heavily on the ODrive python and Arduino libraries.

## Roadmap
- [x] Arduino Parity
- [ ] Basic ASCII Protocol
- [ ] Property Reads/Writes

## Documentation

## Current State
Currently, only the ASCII protocol is supported.
We support the operations found within the Arduino library, which this
project began as a reimplementation of. We plan on adding support for
more operations, and easier reads and writes of properties.
