# odrive-rs
A library for control of ODrive motor controllers.

## Documentation

## Examples

## Current State
Currently, only the ASCII protocol is supported.
We support the operations found within the Arduino library, which this
project began as a reimplementation of. We plan on adding support for
more operations, and easier reads and writes of properties.
